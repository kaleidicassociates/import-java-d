Towards a tool to be able to import classes from Java and call them from D

1. given a description of Java classes and methods - say in XML - generate D wrappers
2. use reflection in Java to generate the description above from the compiled classes

This is internal code I have not yet cleaned up, written to solve the problem at hand.  Changes
will be required to make it work generically.  I am putting it up here in case anyone has time
and interest to do so.
